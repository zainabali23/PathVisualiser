# Graph Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

A React-based tool to visualize A* and Dijkstra's algorithms. Users can interact with the grid by moving start/end points, adding weights, and placing walls to observe real-time pathfinding.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid:** Move start and end points across the grid.
- **Custom Obstacles:** Add or remove walls and weighted nodes.
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Watch as algorithms find the shortest path.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** JavaScript, React.js
- **Styling:** CSS, HTML

## Usage

- **Drag and Drop:** Move the start (green) and end (red) points on the grid.
- **Add Obstacles:** Click to add walls, right-click to remove them.
- **Choose Algorithm:** Select A* or Dijkstra and visualize the pathfinding.
